% Obtain object array representing identified unit item(s) from an Allen Brain Observatory dataset
%
% NOTE: This creator function is currently non-functional. It is expected to be restored in an upcoming release. 
% NOTE: Most known analysis workflows can be carried out using session item information and objects (and subordinate linked objects)
% 
% Supports the Visual Coding 2P [1] dataset from the Allen Brain Observatory [2]. 
%
% Specify item(s) by unique numeric IDs for item. These can be obtained via:
%   * table returned by bot.fetchExperiments() 
%   * tables contained by other item objects (sessions)
%   
% Can also specify item(s) by supplying an information table of the format
% returned by bot.fetchExperiments. This is often useful when such a table has
% been "filtered" to one or a few rows of interest via table indexing
% operations.
